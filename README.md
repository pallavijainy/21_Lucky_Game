# GAME-PAGE
  
  - HOW TO PLAY :
    - The objective of the game is to get a set of cards in which the sum must be 21. Or you can get as close as possible without bursting if you go over 21, you        lose, if the dealer has 21 or less and you have less points than the dealer, you lose.
    - The numbered cards correspond to their respective value, the cards with letters, the situation changes a little, J, Q and K cards are worth 10 points.
       But "A" card has a value of 1.
    - When you start the game, you will decide if you want more cards, or if you want to keep the amount you received, if you want to take more cards, it may           happen that you exceed the score of 21, if that happens you will lose because the dealer will not ask for cards. But, if you still haven't exceeded, a timer       will appear for you to play in up to 6 seconds, if you don't do anything, you will lose your turn (stay).
